 **Introduction**

Upon decolonisation from Portugal in 1975, East Timor came under the violent occupation of Suharto’s military regime up till 1999, before finally gaining independence in 2002\. Throughout this turbulent period, up to 200,000 of the East Timorese population had died due to armed conflict, starvation and diseases. 

The Suharto regime justified and attributed the motivation behind the Indonesian invasion and 2-decade long occupation to the Communist threat posed by the left-leaning FRETILIN (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor**)** party which unilaterally declared East Timor’s independence on 29 November 1975\. Fearing that the creation of a communist state at the backyard of the Indonesian archipelago could jeopardize Indonesia’s national security, the Indonesian Government devised and conduct three strategic-level operations[^1] which was aimed to integrate East Timor into Indonesia as its 27th province. This inclination to annex the territory was further perpetuated by the consent of the USA and Australia leaders who provided assurance to Suharto of their compliance during their meetings in 1975 and 1974 respectively.

However, evidences also pointed out the economic exploitation the Suharto regime benefitted from this occupation. This is seen in the monopolization of most of East Timor’s industries by P.T. Batara Indra Group, which is affiliated to the Indonesian military and is a conglomerate of many subsidiaries owned by various military generals and Suharto’s cronies and family members. Moreover, the potentially rich oil resources in the Timor Gap[^2] would also lure more foreign oil companies to invest in Indonesian oil concessionaries. Thus, the vast extent of the exploitation of the resources in East Timor is seen as a subsidiary to the crony capitalistic nature of the Suharto regime.

The inclination to occupy East Timor was also aimed at furthering Suharto’s political interests domestically and in the international arena. Suharto’s justification to remove the supposed Communist presence in East Timor was viewed favourably by external allies (USA and Australia), who feared that a ‘second Cuba’ within the Indonesian archipelago could emerge, and this support given by the allies could boost Indonesia’s diplomatic standings. Simultaneously, military generals and businessmen owning companies in East Timor would remain loyal to the New Order regime, strengthening Suharto’s political grip domestically.

Therefore, this essay aims to examine the significance of the factors at play that contributed to Indonesia’s increasing propensity to annex East Timor. It analyses how the potential economic exploitation of East Timor’s natural resources could have served as the main motivation towards Indonesia’s decision to occupy while questioning the threat of Communist presence in East Timor as its primary justification. The Indonesians played upon the fear of the communist threat and used it as a leverage to propagate their other agendas of occupying it for other interests. The economic interests of the Suharto government in exploiting the resources also transcend towards the political ambition of the New Order regime in attempting to further strengthen its political authority.

**CHAPTER 2**

**The Veneer of Communism**

In April 1974, East Timor’s colonial master – Portugal – underwent a major political upheaval known as the Carnation Revolution. Following which, territories that were subjects of the Portuguese colonial empire underwent a rapid decolonization process, including East Timor. During the decolonization period three major political parties emerged, one of which was the ASDT (Associação Social Democrática Timorense) – later renamed FRETILIN – which favoured total independence from the Portuguese colonialists[^3]. As such, Suharto’s staunch anti-communist regime[^4] used the potential rise in communist movements within East Timor as a pretext to justify the need to conduct operations there with the ultimate goal of integrating the region to Indonesia. 

The Indonesian government also sought to persuade the Western allies (including the US and Australia) that East Timor posed a Communist threat to their national security. Suharto’s intentions of validating communism as a justification to occupy the territory were explicitly stated during his meetings with US President Gerald Ford and Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. In his conversation with President Ford[^5] on 5th July 1975, he remarked that while Indonesia support carrying out Timor’s decolonization through the process of self-determination, the “problem is that those who want independence are those who are Communist-influenced”.  He also suggested to Whitlam[^6] that Indonesia and Australia had identical strategic interests in Portuguese Timor, where an independent Timor-Leste would be prey to China or the Soviet Union and thus ‘a thorn in the eye of Australia and a thorn in the back of Indonesia’.

However, the genuineness of the justification is questionable considering Indonesia’s actions prior to the violent incursion into East Timor on 7 December 1975\.

In October 1974, the Indonesian Government carried out a campaign of destabilization known as Operation Komodo. This disinformation campaign was conducted to East Timor through the Indonesian military-affiliated paper Berita Yudha and hostile radio broadcasts originating from a Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) station in Kupang, West Timor[^7]. The propaganda media outlets fabricated unfounded stories of Vietnamese and Chinese infiltration into the territory, as the Indonesian operatives started briefing foreign ambassadors about the threat posed by FRETILIN.

In addition, after FRETILIN and another political party, the UDT (Timorese Democratic Union) formed a coalition on 21 January 1975 on the basis of their shared commitment to full independence, the New Order Regime expanded their rhetoric on the threat of communism by fuelling distrust between parties to undermine the alliance. The Indonesian military provided the UDT with false intelligence reports of an impending power grab by FRETILIN in August 1975, complemented with ‘clandestine Chinese arms shipments and “Vietnamese terrorists” entering East Timor’[^8] to aid FRETILIN. In fact, these fabricated reports were being taken in by Bishop Riberio, who would then inform the UDT leaders that 26 to 28 North Vietnamese holding Portuguese passports and posing as Chinese had entered East Timor to train FRETILIN supporters. When asked to prove, he stated ‘I am your Bishop, you must believe me\!’. This allegation had a profound effect in further convincing the UDT that they had to prepare for an armed confrontation with FRETILIN[^9]. The misinformation gave UDT the impetus to mount a failed coup on 11 August, and with FRETILIN’s successful counteroffensive and recapture of the area, Indonesia was able to justify their invasion as a means of toppling and restore order and stability back in East Timor.  

Contrary to popular belief, the magnitude of Communist influence in East Timor was also limited as only a small fraction of the parties have communist links – rather, the parties favouring independence adopted more of a nationalist mindset. Mari Alkatiri, one of the founders of FRETILIN and its Minister for Political Affairs, asserted that ‘FRETILIN’s ‘revolutionary’ and occasionally violent position was necessary to bring about a revolutionary social change to address the illiteracy, hunger and poverty of colonised East Timor, and such reflected a leftist – but not necessarily communist – vision’[^10]. Moreover, General Benny Moerdani[^11], a key orchestrator of the operations in East Timor commented during a session with US assistant secretary Habib that ‘FRETILIN has five or six communist or strongly Marxist individuals in its leadership, but on the whole it is a fairly reasonable organization with far more prospect politically than the UDT or APODETI’, that ‘there is no major threat of external intervention’ and ‘in any event, there was little likelihood of effective Soviet or Chinese involvement’. He also admitted that there were many Indonesians ‘with a more alarmist view of the situation’[^12], proving that the Communist threats had been greatly overblown by the Indonesian forces.

As such, the Indonesian forces greatly exaggerated the prominence of Communism posed by FRETILIN with its heavy manipulation of the state media radio broadcasts and its attempts to rile up conflict between political parties that were favouring independence. It questions whether Indonesia’s anti-communist propaganda was a ‘sincere, if misguided, expression of the regime’s fervent anti-communism or an attempt to manipulate the issue to justify intervention’[^13]. It suggests that Suharto’s government had manipulated the Cold War situation by striking fear within the Western nations of a potential Communist foothold in order to gain their consent to invade, showing that the government may not have been most concerned about the Communist threat, and rather they may have had other motivations in occupying East Timor.

**CHAPTER 3**

**East Timor – An Economic Goldmine**

After the overthrow of Sukarno’s government in 1965, major policy restructuring took

place under the New Order regime led by Suharto, who constructed a strong, centralised and military-dominated government. The authoritarian regime removed all forms of democratic processes as a means to maintain political order, and emphasized on the development of the economy.

 As the Indonesian military \- the Armed Forces of Indonesia (ABRI) \- had a ‘dwifunsgi’ role of ruling the nation as well as its traditional role of national defence, it was therefore heavily involved in participating in Indonesia’s economic development. This was done through the seizing of profitable areas of the state sector, where the military officers, who were part of Suharto’s group of cronies, held key positions in the state-owned corporations. Such examples include the appointment of General Ibnu Suwoto as the head of Pertamina, the nation’s state-owned oil and natural gas corporation based in Jakarta[^14].

Indonesia also began to take an interest in East Timor’s abundance of natural resources in the 1970s. Under colonial rule from 1702 to 1975, East Timor was under Portuguese control and was part of the trading networks stretching between India and China. Among its major industries was the cultivation of coffee, which the Portuguese introduced in the mid-19th century. Additionally, the potentially rich oil resources found in the Timor Gap – between Australia and Timor Island – brought about further attention to the Indonesian leaders as a ‘potential economic goldmine’[^15].

Following the decolonization of Portugal from East Timor, coupled with the seeming presence of Communist elements within the territory, the New Order regime was now given a new impetus to infiltrate into the region and reap the economic benefits. Following the invasion of East Timor and the ABRI’s (Indonesian National Armed Forced) successful takeover of the territory in 7th December 1975, it began heavily exploiting East Timor’s resources for the next 25 years under Indonesian rule. Indonesian interests took over former Portuguese colonial business enterprises such as the SAPT (Sociedade Agricola Patria é Trabalho) which possessed large plantations (mostly coffee), and was re-operated as P.T. Salazar Coffee Plantations[^16]. These companies came under as subsidiaries of a larger conglomerate known as the P.T. Batara Indra Group[^17] which was set up by General Benny Moerdani. The conglomerate firm oversaw the monopolization of other industries including sandalwood plantations and even hotels and cinemas. The creation of the monopoly resulted in increased production levels but yet a decrease in the incomes of small East Timorese farmers, as farmers were only allowed to sell their products, particularly coffee to the monopoly at prices far below the market rates. This practice allowed the military-backed monopoly to profit from extensively at nearly thirty million dollars annually from coffee seizures alone[^18].

Suharto’s family members also established various companies that would challenge the monopoly controlled by the Indonesian military. These included PT Nusa Bhakti, owned by Madame Tien Suharto, wife of the President, and PT Lianbau, set up by Suharto’s brother-in-law Lieutenant General Prabowo, where the enterprises were able to use the power of the New Order government to establish their dominance.  
On 11 December 1989, the Timor Gap treaty was signed. This allowed for the joint exploitation of oil resources in a part of the Timor Sea seabed claimed by both Australia and Indonesia. The Suharto family also engaged in capitalistic ventures into the Timor Sea oil reserves. It set up a new oil company in Perth, Genindo Western Petroleum Propriety Limited, and was headed by Bambang Trihatmodjo, Suharto's middle son[^19].

The exploitation of East Timorese resources reveals the crony capitalism pervading Suharto’s regime which had served as the bedrock for economic growth in Indonesia. It suggests that the government and military had the propensity to occupy East Timor for the potential economic gains it would benefit from, as seen in the takeover of the entire coffee industry from the Portuguese and the formation of large conglomerates owned by Suharto’s cronies (including the Indonesian military generals) and even his own family members, essentially monopolizing the entire East Timorese economy. The lucrative businesses gained from the exploitation therefore serves as an underlying motivation in the desire to invade East Timor, and it also contributed to the reluctance of Indonesia to accede independence to the East Timorese citizens for the next 25 years, even after the Cold War had ended where the supposed Communist threat posed by FRETILIN ceased. 

In light of the extensive exploitation of East Timor’s resources, it became clear that the Suharto regime’s proclivity to occupy East Timor was further motivated by its wider economic interests from monopolizing the entire East Timorese economy and the continued reception of financial aid by Western counterparts. It was additionally important that the Suharto regime delivers economic growth and recovery, as the legitimacy of his government was inextricably tied to its ability to deliver stability and growth. Therefore, it is not substantial enough to justify that the New Order’s decision to invade East Timor was solely due to the economic benefits reaped from exploitation. Rather, the government’s economic motivations and strategies towards East Timor served to further the government’s political interests through the consolidation of Suharto’s power and advancing Indonesia’s position abroad. 

**Chapter 4**

 **The New Order’s Political Ambitions** 

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the assertion that the basis for the invasion and continued occupation was wholly due to Indonesia’s economic intentions is not strong enough to stand as a primary motivation. This chapter therefore analyses how the foundational economic motivation to occupy East Timor also serves to accentuate the Indonesian government’s strategic interests in sealing its domestic political legitimacy while fostering international relations with the Western allies.

While the economic development of Indonesia played a cardinal role in legitimizing the New Order’s political standing, Suharto’s encouragement of military participation in the economy through the crony capitalistic management of the regime led many of his cronies to assume key corporation positions. The ABRI generals’ control of their own financial resources gave them a bigger stake in the status quo and helped ensure their loyalty to the New Order regime. This is exemplified through the case of East Timor, where General Moerdani dominated the entire economy under the Batara Indra Group. As such, the granting of unchecked power in key monopolies in East Timor to the military generals and businessmen associated with Suharto’s government thus ensured that they would pledge their allegiance to the New Order regime. This well serves to further consolidate the Suharto government’s political power in the domestic arena as the regime would be unchallenged by any opposing forces.

Additionally, the Indonesian government tended to gravitate towards the Western bloc to seek economic assistance, especially since its economy was in a parlous state from the mismanagement of the Sukarno years. Indonesia’s eventual annexation and continued occupation of East Timor to suppress the supposed Communist elements present in the territory acted as a means to affirm Suharto’s commitment to its anti-communist stance in the Southeast Asia towards its Western allies. By aligning itself with the Western bloc against Communism, it stood to gain further economic assistance from the Western-allied nations with opportunities for increased trade and investment. This also ensured the continual arrival of developmental aid from the Inter-Governmental Group of Indonesia (IGGI), made of Japan, the US, European nations and multilateral aid agencies like World Bank in the 1970s[^20]. 

There were also further incentives for the Western camp, particularly the USA and Australia, to cast their support behind the Indonesian government’s occupation of East Timor for strategic reasons. The US was eager to safeguard its access to the extremely deep straits off East Timor, where nuclear submarines could slip undetected between the Pacific and Indian oceans[^21]. The business interests of USA and Australia in the Timor Gap[^22] further served as a further incentive for supporting Indonesia’s continued occupation[^23]. Therefore, the strong political backing of the Western nation had further enticed the Indonesian government’s decision to annex and occupy East Timor, sealing Suharto’s grip on power. 

The inclination to occupy East Timor was also further perpetuated by the fear that by granting independence, it could inspire secessionist movements in other provinces such as Aceh to demand the same treatment given to East Timor, resulting in the potential fragmentation of the entire Indonesian archipelago[^24]. This was well observed following East Timor’s ballot for independence in 1999 where it fuelled discontent in some of the regions[^25], undermining the Indonesian government’s goal of consolidating political control and unification of the nation, threatening Indonesia’s political stability. Thus, the incursion and occupation of East Timor would serve to strengthen national security and tighten the New Order’s political control.

The manipulative characteristic of Suharto’s regime therefore serves as an indication of how the desire to occupy East Timor for the next 25 years was to reap the economic benefits from exploiting the resources and obtaining financial aid, while simultaneously attempting to consolidate the government’s political authority domestically and strengthen its international relations with the Western allies.

**Chapter 5**

**Conclusion**

The economic motivation of the occupation of East Timor was hinged on two levels: the continued reliance on financial aid from Western counterparts for economic growth as Indonesia had proved its strong anti-communist stance, as well as business interests in East Timor through the formation of conglomerates that monopolized the entire economy.

The threat of Communism was used as a façade to justify the Indonesian government’s need to invade East Timor, where the Indonesian government propagated the fears of the western powers that an independent East Timor might become an ‘Asian Cuba’ through cultivating the image of FRETILIN as Communist.

Indonesia’s economic motivation in occupying East Timor also served the political ambitions of the Suharto regime. The granting of business favours to corrupted political and military leaders in East Timor was essential in maintaining their loyalty to the regime, therefore enhancing the regime’s political power. In addition, the regime managed to prove itself as an anti-communist ally to the Western camp enabling them to form stronger diplomatic relations, resultantly strengthening its political legitimacy on the international stage.

In light of this, the economic motivations behind the occupation of East Timor were meant to serve the overriding political aim of preserving the Suharto regime. Suharto needed continued economic development to cement his grip on power, both in terms of ensuring the popular legitimacy of his government and in preserving the allegiance of the military and business sector. In order to fund his economic policies, he also needed continued support from important foreign donors, and the occupation of East Timor permitted him to preserve their support and funding in a variety of ways. Hence, it can be concluded that the economic considerations behind the occupation of East Timor were meant to meet a variety of Suharto's political objectives, with the ultimate aim of maintaining the legitimacy and strength of his authoritarian government.

Operation Flamboyan soon followed in the early 1975, which sent Indonesian-trained East Timorese across the border to take the country by force.
